Overview

For this assignment, I would like you to use the Apache Commons CSV library to parse a CSV file that contains real estate data and calculate certain statistics from the file.

Project Setup

Please set up a new Java project with Maven. Using Maven's dependency management capabilities, please include the Apache Commons CSV library (Links to an external site.) from the exercise we did in class. Please also set up your project as a Git repository.

Data

Please download this CSV file  Download this CSV file(manually not in Java). It contains data about house sales in California from a few years ago. Please include this file in the root directory of your Java project. Your program will read this file and parse the data using the library above.

Code

Please write some Java code that reads the file above, parses the data and calculates the following information:

Average price of the homes sold in the dataset (overall)
Average square footage
Minimum and Maximum price for homes in Sacremento
Your code should output these answers by printing to Standard Out (System.out.println). Please include labels and minor in your output text so that you're not printing out raw numbers.

Submitting

To submit this assignment, please create a private GitHub repository and add me as a collaborator. You can submit the link to the repository.
